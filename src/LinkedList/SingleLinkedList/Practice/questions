### **Beginner Level**
1. **Create and Print a Linked List**
   - Implement a function to create a single linked list.
   - Traverse and print the elements.

2. **Insert Node at the Beginning, End, and Middle**
   - Write functions to insert a node at the beginning, end, and a specific position in the list.

3. **Delete Node by Value or Position**
   - Remove a node from the list by its value or position.

4. **Reverse a Linked List**
   - Implement an iterative and recursive approach to reverse the linked list.

5. **Find Length of the Linked List**
   - Count the number of nodes in the list using iteration and recursion.

### **Intermediate Level**
6. **Detect and Remove a Loop in Linked List**
   - Use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (slow and fast pointer) to detect a loop and remove it.

7. **Find Nth Node from the End**
   - Use the two-pointer approach to find the Nth node from the end in a single pass.

8. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**
   - Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

9. **Check if the Linked List is a Palindrome**
   - Use a stack or reverse the second half of the list to check for palindrome properties.

10. **Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Linked List**
   - Traverse the list and remove duplicate nodes in a sorted linked list.

### **Advanced Level**
11. **Flatten a Linked List**
   - Flatten a linked list where each node has two pointers: `next` and `child` pointing to another linked list.

12. **Intersection of Two Linked Lists**
   - Find the node where two linked lists intersect, if any, using length-based or two-pointer techniques.

13. **Rotate a Linked List**
   - Rotate the linked list by a given number of positions (both left and right rotations).

14. **Sort a Linked List**
   - Sort the linked list using merge sort or quick sort.

15. **Clone a Linked List with Random Pointers**
   - Clone a linked list where each node has a random pointer in addition to the next pointer.

### **How to Practice?**
1. **Understand Concepts**: Before solving problems, ensure you are familiar with linked list basics (node structure, pointers, etc.).
2. **Code & Debug**: Write the code by hand, debug errors, and analyze the time complexity.
3. **Optimize Solutions**: Once you solve a problem, look for ways to improve space and time efficiency.
4. **LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks**: These platforms offer problem statements, hints, and discussions.
